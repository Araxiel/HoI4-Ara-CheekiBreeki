[h1]What this mod does[/h1]
[list=1]
[*] Cheeki Breeki
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
One of my aims of all my mods is always as much compatibility as possible. Should be compatible with every other type of mod. However, other mods that change the Russian voice files will of course be overwritten (not like there are any out there).

This mod is [u]not[/u] ironman compatible.

[h1]To-Do:[/h1][list]
